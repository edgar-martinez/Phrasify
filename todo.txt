SQL stuff
    part 1:
    - create a sql database
    - put all the CSV data in a sql table
    - Remove duplicates
    part 2:
    - add a column to the table, call it something like "simplified title"
    - convert the title by
    -- making it all lowercase
    -- converting/removing weird characters
    (this will make searches more simple, but we want to keep the original title)
    part 3:
    - create a set of all words (any word any song)
    - add it as a table in SQL
    part 4:
    - figure out how to make SQL queries from javascript code (connect to the database, form a query, parse the result)

clean data
    - remove [Bonus track], (feat. )

Optimizations
    - index each song with "substitution" lists that allow breaking the song into smaller parts (if possible)
    - debounce the user input so it doesn't flood the backend with queries
    - create an inverted index for faster seaching of "does song title contain"
    -- use the index to find all songs with all the words
    -- then linearly iterate over those to make sure the words are in the correct order
    
Probably wont do
    - create multiple copies of the data and use multithreading
    - eventually find a good way of suggesting likely canidates (rather than picking any canidate)
