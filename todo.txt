- create a "allWords" table in solr
    - create an efficient way to partial search it

Optimizations
    - index each song with "substitution" lists that allow breaking the song into smaller parts (if possible)
    - debounce the user input so it doesn't flood the backend with queries
    - create an inverted index for faster seaching of "does song title contain"
    -- use the index to find all songs with all the words
    -- then linearly iterate over those to make sure the words are in the correct order
    
Probably wont do
    - create multiple copies of the data and use multithreading
    - eventually find a good way of suggesting likely canidates (rather than picking any canidate)
